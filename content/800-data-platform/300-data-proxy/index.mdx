Serverless functions are ephemeral and short-lived, so their database connections are numerous and brief.

Because of this, using traditional databases in serverless environments often leads to the exhaustion of the maximum number of concurrent database connections and increased latencies when each request needs to establish a database connection.

Data Proxy in the Prisma Data Platform provides database connection management and pooling, load balancing, scaling, and fault tolerance so that you can manage and scale database connections for applications that run with Prisma ORM in serverless environments. With Data Proxy, your application can scale and maintain predictable database performance as it also limits the total number of database connections.

Designed specifically with serverless functions in mind, Data Proxy provides a wide range of benefits for applications that run in serverless and edge environments.

## Architecture

Prisma develops and maintains the Data Proxy infrastructure and services to provide connection pooling, load balancing, scaling, and fault tolerance for applications that run in serverless and edge environments.

Data Proxy infrastructure is currently available in two regions:

* US East 1 (West Virginia, United States)
* EU Central 1 (Frankfurt, Germany)

Multiple clusters in each region enable the load balancing, high availability, and fault tolerance capabilities of Data Proxy.

You can use Data Proxy with [all databases that Prisma ORM supports](/reference/database-reference/supported-databases).

## Connection pooling and connection management

Data Proxy provides connection pooling so that you application can reuse active database connections and prevent the exhaustion of the maximum concurrent database connections due to the ephemeral and short-lived nature of serverless functions.

Connection pooling with the Data Proxy utilizes orchestrated Prisma [query engine](/concepts/components/prisma-engines/query-engine) technology to open, maintain, and close connection pools and, thus, help applications load-balance and scale database requests based on demand.

A Data Proxy connection pool maintains open database connections and ensures that an application reuses open connections when new requests come in.

In each region, Data Proxy management services orchestrate the lifecycle of connection pools for your application. The lifecycle of a Data Proxy connection pool can include the following stages:

* the assignment of highly available connection pools from each available cluster in the region
* the start of additional connection pools when the workload of your application increases
* the maintenance of idle connection pools
* the stop of connection pools after six minutes of no new database requests

This orchestration ensures that you aggregate Data Proxy usage (in CPU milliseconds) only when your application demands it.

## Reduced bundle size

When you generate Prisma Client to work with Data Proxy, the query engine logic to connect and maintain connection pools is delegated to Data Proxy. As a result, you have a reduced bundle size for your application which helps to speed up load times and enable faster performance.

For more information see, [Bundle size](/data-platform/data-proxy/bundle-size).

## Cold starts prevention

Data Proxy prevents unnecessary serverless cold starts because it keeps the existing database connections live and reuses them for new incoming requests. This prevents the cold start of new containers whenever serverless functions are invoked after the first cold start.

## High availability

In each region, the Data Proxy infrastructure consists of multiple clusters. By default and until your application reaches higher workloads, Data Proxy starts and assigns a connection pool to an application from each cluster. If any of the clusters experiences downtime, the remaining clusters take over the management of connection pools.

**Note**<br /><br />

You can select only one of the available regions for an environment of your application in the Prisma Data Platform.

Because of this, the high availability of Data Proxy infrastructure applies within a single region. Data Proxy connection pools from other regions cannot take over an application's connection pool from the current region.

</Admonition>

## Load balancing and scalability

In each region, the number of incoming requests for an application is load-balanced between multiple connection pools running from the different clusters available in the region.

This architecture allows the Data Proxy to create new connection pools in cases of higher demand and to close connection pools in cases of lower activity and provides the flexible capabilities of scaling your application demands as necessary.
